## Museum Data Analysis Project

### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing museum data using SQL queries. The dataset includes information about museums, paintings, opening hours, prices, styles, and more.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following tables:

- `museum`: Contains information about museums such as name, city, and state.
- `museum_hours`: Provides details about museum opening hours for each day of the week.
- `work`: Contains data about paintings, including their titles, artists, styles, and prices.
- `product_size`: Includes information about the size of each painting.
- `subject`: Provides details about painting subjects.
- `canvas_size`: Contains data about the canvas sizes used for paintings.
- `artist`: Includes information about artists such as their names and nationalities.

### SQL Queries

The project involves writing SQL queries to perform various analyses on the museum data, including:

- Identifying museums open on specific days and for specific durations.
- Analyzing painting prices and identifying paintings with asking prices higher than regular prices.
- Finding the most popular and least popular painting styles.
- Analyzing artists' works and identifying characteristics such as the number of paintings and styles.
- Identifying paintings with duplicate records and removing them from the dataset.
- Analyzing museum hours data to identify anomalies or invalid entries.

### Files

- `queries.sql`: Contains the SQL queries used for data analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file explaining the project and its components.
- `questions.txt`: Includes a list of questions and notes related to the data analysis.
- `data_csv_files.py`: Python script for handling CSV files and data processing tasks.
